# Overview

This is an open-source script I use for getting non-common links in Demozoo for the demoscene preservation.

# How to use

Download [demozoo-parsing.sh](https://github.com/m100bit/demozoo-parsing-experiments/blob/main/demozoo-parsing.sh) and execute it. <br />
Wait for a few couple of minutes and follow the instructions in the end. 

# Supporting

Works in Debian/Ubuntu-like distros. <br />
Not tested on RHEL-based distros, Alpine Linux, Arch Linux and openSUSE, but should work. <br />
Probably won't work in Gentoo. <br />
With higher chance won't work in MacOS.

# Last words

Sorry for my bad English. At least I'm trying. <br />
Greetings to Demozoo team and contributors. <3
